### Frontend Development

Flutter is an open-source Software Development Kit (SDK) used to develop high-performing Android and iOS applications with a single code base. It uses Dart Programming language. I chose flutter over native android because of its cross-platform support and the ability to build a highly customized and attractive app in less time. 

The most crucial part is, from a small button to padding or font, everything in Flutter is a widget. These widgets can be combined to form an amazing layout with beautiful UI/UX. There are inbuilt as well as customizable widgets which makes the building of the app faster.
